# How to play
To defeat a low-level hostile mob such as a wolf or orc, you'll need a weapon such as a dagger.
Higher level mobs need higher level weapons such as a bow or sword.
Some weapons have prerequisites; you need a quiver in you inventory to use a bow.

Peaceful play means talking to friendly mobs such as ravens or elves, and drinking potions, reading scrolls, etc.

# Legendary mobs and items
There are legendary mobs in the game, such as Nazgul, Ringwraiths, Balrogs, and witch-kings. You need a legendary item to even have a chance of defeating them.

You can acquire legendary weapons by opening chests with the "LOOTBOX!" command.
Even with a legendary weapon, however, you only have  a 50% chance of success.
