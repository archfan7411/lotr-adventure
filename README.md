# How to play
To defeat a low-level hostile mob such as a wolf or orc, you'll need a weapon such as a dagger.
Higher level mobs need higher level weapons such as a bow or sword.
Some weapons have prerequisites; you need a quiver in you inventory to use a bow.

Peaceful play means talking to friendly mobs such as ravens or elves, and drinking potions, reading scrolls, etc.

# Legendary mobs and items
There are legendary mobs in the game, such as Nazgul, Ringwraiths, Balrogs, and witch-kings. You need a legendary item to even have a chance of defeating them.

You can acquire legendary weapons by opening chests with the "LOOTBOX!" command.
Even with a legendary weapon, however, you only have  a 50% chance of success.

# Future features
I intend to add additional features:
- Swords need a scabbard
- Regions such as the fields of Rohan and the depths of Mirkwood, which will influence the randomness.
- Talking to friendly mobs is more interactive
- You can buy powers with points
- Shields increase your chances against legendary mobs
- You have a choice as to where to go next, e.g. "a gate leads out of the area, and there is a path to the southwest."
